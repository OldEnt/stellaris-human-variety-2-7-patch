This patch updates a single file to make [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1074841707]Human Variety[/url] work in Stellaris 3.0, 2.8+ and 2.7+.

\prescripted_countries\00_top_countries.txt

GitHub: https://github.com/OldEnt/stellaris-human-variety-2-7-patch

The original overwrite does not support new origins system introduced in Stellaris 2.7+ and therefore it breaks Commonwealth of Man prescripted empire. While I cannot remove the overwrite, I can make it up to date.

This patch is set as  a dependant on Human Variety so load order should not matter. You can still put it below Human Variety in the load order if you want to.

This mod will be deleted from the Steam Workshop when the core mod gets an update.
